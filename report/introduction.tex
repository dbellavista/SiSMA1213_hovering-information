\section{Introduction}
\emph{Hovering Information} is a geo-localized information dissemination
service, proposed in \cite{hover}, able to work without a centralized
infrastructure. The service is aimed to mobile users capable of peer-to-peer
communication and geo-localization.

Since the service must work in an dynamic infrastructure-free
environment with a self-organizing behaviour, a MAS approach may
offer a sound paradigm for both hovering information implementation
and simulation.
