# SiSMA1213 - Hovering Information implementation and simulation using MAS and complex networks theory.

This project, developed for Multi-Agents System course, is aimed to
realize an *Hovering Information* system using a multi-agent approach
for implementation and simulation and concept and models from complex
network theory for analysis.

## Project Content

The repository is structured as following:

* Report
	* Introduction
	* AOSE process (SODA)
	* Simulator implementation
	* Analysis Results
* MAS implementation
* Simulator Implementation
* Network analysis implementation
* Presentation

## Background
### Hovering Information

> Hovering Information - Infrastructure-Free Self-Organising Location-Aware Information Dissemination Service, Alfredo A. Villalba Castro, Giovanna Di Marzo Serugendo, and Dimitri Konstantas

### Simulation

A possible approach:

> Human Mobility in Shopping Mall Environments, Adriano Galati, Chris Greenhalgh

### Data Analysis

*TODO*

## MAS Engineering methodology

SODA (Societies in Open and Distributed Agent spaces) methodology used.
